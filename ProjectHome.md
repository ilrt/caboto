## What is Caboto? ##

Basically, its an RDF-based web annotations system.

Three [JISC](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/)-funded projects have a requirement to allow people to annotate events and other things. The projects are:

  * [Collaborative Research on the Web (CREW)](http://www.crew-vre.net) - University of Bristol and University of Manchester
  * [Semantic Tools for Screen Arts Research (STARS)](http://stars.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/blog/) - University of Bristol
  * [Integration Project (CIP)](http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/whatwedo/projectsaz/project?search=CIP%20Content%20Integration%20ProjectContent) - University of Bristol

The **Caboto** project was setup to create a collaborative effort to fulfill the requirements of CREW, STARS and CIP.

The requirements from the JISC projects:

  * [CREW Events Requirements](CrewEventsRequirements.md)
  * [CIP Requirements](CIP_Annotation_Requirements.md)
  * [STARS Requirements](StarsRequirements.md)

The project is in the early stages but its is possible to obtain and run the project:

  * [Compile and Running Caboto](CompileAndRun.md)
  * [The RESTFul API](RestfulResources.md)
